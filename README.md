# Kitchen Chaos

A fast-paced cooking game I developed following this [10 hour course by Code Monkey.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg&t=24979s)

The game places the player in the role of a chef. The objective of the game is to deliver as many orders as the player can within the time limit. Each order successfully delivered provides bonus time for the player.
